## Performance Reviews

### Performance Reviews at Contoso Electronics

At Contoso Electronics, we strive to ensure our employees are getting the feedback they
need to continue growing and developing in their roles. We understand that performance
reviews are a key part of this process and it is important to us that they are conducted in an
effective and efficient manner.

Performance reviews are conducted annually and are an important part of your career
development. During the review, your supervisor will discuss your performance over the
past year and provide feedback on areas for improvement. They will also provide you with
an opportunity to discuss your goals and objectives for the upcoming year.

Performance reviews are a two-way dialogue between managers and employees. We
encourage all employees to be honest and open during the review process, as it is an
important opportunity to discuss successes and challenges in the workplace.

We aim to provide positive and constructive feedback during performance reviews. This
feedback should be used as an opportunity to help employees develop and grow in their
roles.

Employees will receive a written summary of their performance review which will be
discussed during the review session. This written summary will include a rating of the
employee's performance, feedback, and goals and objectives for the upcoming year.

We understand that performance reviews can be a stressful process. We are committed to
making sure that all employees feel supported and empowered during the process. We
encourage all employees to reach out to their managers with any questions or concerns
they may have.

We look forward to conducting performance reviews with all our employees. They are an
important part of our commitment to helping our employees grow and develop in their
roles.
